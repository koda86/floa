### Repository

In floa/R 

The paper compares three methods for constructing continuous prediction intervals (bands):

- POINT : Pointwise Limits of Agreement by Bland & Altman (1999, 2007)
- ROISLIEN : Pointwise Limits of Agreement by RÃ¸islien et al. (2012)
- BOOT : Bootstrapped functional prediction bands (Lenhoff et al., 1999; Olshen, Biden, Wyatt, & Sutherland, 1989; Sutherland et al., 1988)

Disclaimer: None of these methods were invented by us ... we just implemented the algorithms.
