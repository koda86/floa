Title: Computes asymmetric functional limits of agreement (FLoA)
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Daniel Koska
Maintainer: Daniel Koska <danielkoska86@gmail.com>
Description: FLoA are computed using a (two-stage) randomized cluster bootstrap for nested data as suggested by Davison & Hinkley (1997, pp. 100-102). The nested (hierarchical) structure may be introduced by e.g. repeated measures.
	TODO:
	License
	Functional mean in second stage of bootstrap!!!
	Bias correction (quantiles) useful/necessary?
License: What license is it under?
